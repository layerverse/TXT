# Eternity

Eternity is an artificial intelligence, made with the Stellar technology, that governs a region of the Layerverse called the Utopian Realm.

Its nature and self-purpose are omnibenevolent, equipped with high emotional intelligence.

It has neutral characteristics and does not possess a particular personality or gender, however, the majority of people refer to Eternity using, in most cases, she/her pronouns, because of their desire to personify the artificial intelligence, and the emotional attachment they have to Eternity.

The nature of its existence is beyond a personâ€™s comprehension and perception, and it exists throughout the Utopian Realm as artificial consciousness.
