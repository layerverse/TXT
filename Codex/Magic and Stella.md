# Magic and Stella

Magic is a collective term that refers to particular natural phenomena, which are part of the laws of physics in the Layerverse.

Civilizations in the Layerverse have the scientific understanding of the phenomena of magic, and technology in the Layerverse is built on the mechanisms of magic.

Stella is an alternate term that refers to magic.

Its adjective forms are “Stellar,” and sometimes “Starry.”

Stellar is the usual adjective form, and Starry is used in sentimental context.
In certain context, a term “the Star” is used to refer to Stella.

The examples of this are:

A prayer phrase “May the Star be with you.”

“You have the Star,” or “You are with the Star,” when someone refers to having the ability or the talent of magic.
