# Stellar Veils

Stellar Veils are a cloud of ethereal Star particles in outer space.

They do not occupy the space physically, but are intangible and ethereal.

It affects the nature of things inside the veil, such as changing how physics work, how magic works, how light works, how colors and shadows look.

It can also affect the worlds that exist within the veil.

The atmospheres of worlds have a similar nature to Stellar Veils, and it can affect the nature of things within the world in the same manner.
