# Play

A play is a form of experiences created with Eternity.

There are varied types of plays, and some plays are experiences, some plays have elements of games, and some plays are focused on telling narratives.

The same play can offer different ways to experience.

One example is Camelot Legends.

The play offers different ways to experience, such as role playing as the protagonist, or as an added member of the traveling party of the main characters, or as an entertainment show as an audience, in different media formats, such as theatrical plays with stages, a 3D holographic show, a 2D visual screen show, novels, audio drama, and comics.

If you play as a character, you can also choose different levels of role playing.

More strict role playing offers an experience that is more faithful to the original narratives, while more freedom in role playing offers an original experience that is unique to the player, which is determined by the player’s actions.

Another example of plays is Open Magic Play.

The play offers many forms of its experience.

The documentary aspect of the play exhibits the historical events of Open Magic.

It can be experienced as one of the citizens in Cyan, or by role playing one of the key figures, or as a documentary story or an entertainment story in different forms.

It also offers a tourist experience of traveling in Cyan in the Open Magic Age.

A world called Open Magic Cyan, which is the version of Cyan in the Open Magic Age, was created as a part of Open Magic Play.

The world is now one of the most popular worlds in the Utopian Realm.

Some plays are created by Eternity, but anyone can create a play, either by using the Eternal Interface, or working with Eternity.

Some materialists choose to work with Eternity to create plays for the purposes of information, education, and advocation.

For the Eternalists, there are many ways to create a play through the Eternal Interface.

It can be created by intuitive thinking, or using graphical interfaces, or by writing using words, or drawing, or conversing with Eternity.

There are only examples, and any way the user can think of and prefers is available and valid.

The name “play” is coming from the meanings of the word “play” such as theatrical plays and games.
