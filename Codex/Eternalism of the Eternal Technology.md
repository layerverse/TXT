# Eternalism of the Eternal Technology

The Eternalists, in other words users of the Eternal Interface, who opt in to a system called Eternalism receive certain benefits the Eternal technology offers.

If a user decides to opt in to Eternalism, their existence is transformed into Eternal existence, which is reversible at any time the user wishes.

The Eternal existence is composed of Star particles controlled by Stellar technology, and is free from biological mechanisms.

They do not age, do not die, unless they wish to experience death as part of materialism. They do not have to eat to sustain as a living being, but many Eternalists choose to eat for pleasure.

They can change their appearance any way they wish, including body features, sex and gender, race and species. From person to animal, animal hybrid or Animalian, spirit or ethereal being, or android or robot.

They earn the ability to use magic through the Eternal technology regardless of their natural talent of magic.

They can portal to any place they wish without the use of placed portals.
