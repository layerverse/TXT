# Darkness and Shadows in the Layerverse

Darkness and shadows in the Layerverse are not simply the absence of light. Darkness is a type of light in its own right, which is called dark light. Dark light emits a dark color, which technically a spectrum of electromagnetism, and the distance the color reaches is determined by the strength of the dark light, much the same as how light works.

Stellar Veils and atmospheres of worlds have aptitudes that determine the colors of the shadows and the shades of objects, inside the effective range of the veil or within the world. This is the reason the shadows in some worlds, or in certain areas of space, are not simply the absence of light nor the colors of the reflections from the surroundings.

There are types of magic that benefit from darkness and shadows, or are effected by colors.

Some races and individuals have characteristics that are affected by colors and light, darkness or dark light and shadows.
