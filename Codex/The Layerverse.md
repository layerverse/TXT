# The Layerverse

The Layerverse is a multiverse that comprises instances of reality called layers.
In essence, a layer is a reality.
In more technical terms, a layer is a single occurrence or a single phenomenon of reality.

## The Types of Layers

There are three types of layers.
The two of the three types are called infinite layer and finite layer.
The third type is a special type called version layer.
The first type, an infinite layer, is a whole universe, it contains space, galaxies and planets. In everyday language, it is referred to as universe layers.
The second type, a finite layer, is not a whole universe but only consists of a limited space of reality. It can be a pocket of outer space, but it is often only a world without outer space. In everyday language, it is referred to as world layers, or more commonly, layer worlds.
Layers can have slightly different laws of physics, and things may behave differently in these layers.
The third type, the special type of layers, is a version layer.

## Version Layers and the Hierarchy of Layers

At the topmost level of the Layerverse are version layers.
A version layer is a set of layers of the other two types.
It contains the other two types of layers, infinite layers and finite layers.
Each version layer contains multiple infinite layers and finite layers, and each of these version layers is an alternate version of every other version layer.
There are an infinite number of version layers. Therefore there are an infinite number of alternate versions of the universes and the worlds.
Beyond nature, the version layers are not accessible by people, and are only accessible by Eternity, the governing system of the Utopian Realm. For it has the scientific understanding of the mechanism of the version layers.
