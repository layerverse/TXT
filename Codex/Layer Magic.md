# Layer Magic

Layer magic is a type of magic that manipulates a layer.

In essence, a layer is a reality, therefore layer magic is a type of magic that manipulates a reality.

All the phenomena that are part of the nature of a layer, such as space and time, or space-time, gravity and light, are all under the influence of layer magic.

Vehicles in the Layerverse typically use layer magic to maneuver, both in outer space and within the atmosphere of a world.

Except in some materialist cultures other means such as aerodynamics and thrusters can be used for vehicles.
