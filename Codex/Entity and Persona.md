# Entity and Persona

Entity and Persona are features of the Eternal Interface.

The Eternalists can create multiple instances or existences of themselves called entities, and create multiple identities called personas.

Entities are similar to clones, but the difference is that an Eternalist has an option to have the minds of their entities connected.

The balance and the different combinations of the independence and the connection an individual Eternalist can have for their entities is dependent on their own preference.

One instance of the balance is having the minds of one’s entities simultaneously connected. Another instance is having one’s entities usually independent, but creating special occasions to collect the memories. Some Eternalists collect the memories in materialistic methods, such as journals or visual or audio records, while some others mentally sync the memories but with spiritual rituals. On the other end, some Eternalists have their entities completely independent, similar to clones.

The minds and the bodies of the Eternalists are enhanced, and they are capable of mental operations that would not have been possible without the Eternalism. Their mind can process information and thoughts that have been happening in parallel, which would have been overwhelming without the Eternalism.

Personas are different identities of an individual, which can come with different appearances and/or personalities.

Some Eternalists have separate entities for different personas, while some Eternalists have one entity of themselves but only switching the personas, for any kind of reasons such as according to their moods, or different occasions.

Entities with personas are often simply referred to as “personas,” or “persona entities.”
