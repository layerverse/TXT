# Souls and Spirits

Organisms in the Layerverse have souls.

Souls possess oneâ€™s individual qualities such as identity and consciousness.

Some static objects possess stellar nature similar to souls, but for static objects, this is instead called spirits, or spirit energy, stellar energy.

It is especially called spirits when they take the form of organisms or intelligent beings, and otherwise called spirit or stellar energy.

Spirits are often ethereal and intangible, but it is not uncommon for spirits to also take physical forms.

Some methods of porting and portals teleport targets with physical forms, but some methods instead only teleport souls.
