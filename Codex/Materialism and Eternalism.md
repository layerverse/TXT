# Materialism and Eternalism

Materialism and Eternalism both are a philosophy, a way of life, and a popular culture in the Layerverse.

Materialism as a philosophy and a way of life developed with the evolution of the Eternal technology, to contrast Eternalism.

It values materialistic or physical means and ways of things, opposed to performing these with the Eternal technology.

Materialism as a way of life can come with religious beliefs or spiritualism, but not always, and it can as well be a personal set of beliefs as an individual.

Materialism as a popular culture refers to the uses of materialist ways and means of things, such as physical means of transportation instead of portaling or using portals, having a sleep, eating foods, having the experience of death.

Eternalism, in contrast to materialism, refers to a philosophy and a way of life that accepts the use of the Eternal technology.

It can refer to various levels of the embracement of the Eternal technology, rather than the extreme end of it.

Eternalism and materialism can coexist, with different levels and balances, and combinations, of both.

Most Eternalists adopt some levels of materialism, and most materialists utilize the Eternal technology on some levels.
