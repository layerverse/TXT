# Star Particles

Everything in the Layerverse is made of star particles.

Star particles are born when a star goes into an explosion called a supernova.

A supernova in the Layerverse is not combustion but a burst of light.
This burst of light emits star particles, and it spreads the star particles in space.

When star particles interact with each other, a phenomenon called stellar reactions occurs.

The stellar reactions lead to star particles becoming different states of matter.

All of this leads to the creation of all the matter - all the things in the Layerverse.
