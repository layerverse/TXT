# Riika the Flame On Demon

An alley, dark from the shadow cast by a building towering next to the alley.

The alley was a dead-end with a few shops surrounded by buildings, dark and shaded.

A figure of a man emerged from the shade.

Like a dark mirage, the shadow wavered and formed the shape of a man.

The shadow started to take a solid form, gaining colors.

Wavering and slowly, it turned into a man.

The man had black skin, that of coal black but with a soft sheen.

His eyes were red, and the white eyes black, same as the skin.

Horns were protruding from his temples, pointing to the sky.

He had red hair, matching the colors of his eyes.

From the shade, he began to walk.

The area in front of him was bright, lit by sunlight.

Walking out of the shadow and stepping into the light,

The shadow leaving him and the light casting on his face and body,

His black skin turned to red,

The horns shrinking in size,

His pupils turning to blue.

He wore a suit, of color red, matching his skin and hair, but the shirt blue to contrast the red.

He had his jacket open and unbuttoned, and the shirt part open, typical for a yakuza.

The suit was of the Orien style, with Orien knotting in place of buttons, and the knots were of blue.

He had no eyebrows, the eyes intense.

His ears were pointed, with one earring on his left ear.

The earring was the Orien knotting with a tail, red and swinging with his movements.

His hair red, rough short hair and one-thirds on his left side shaved.

The horns were still on his temples, but small and shrunk in size, red with his skin color.

The sunlight reflected on the red of his skin and the suit, emitting strong red light.

As he walked, he opened a side of his suit jacket, slid his hand into the inside pocket and brought out a cigarette case.

He opened the case, and took out one of the cigarette.

The cigarette had color of red, with the filter part being black.

He put the cigarette into his mouth, with the fingers of his right hand holding the cigarette.

He raised his left hand, faced the palm above.

A small red flame emerged on his palm.

He closed the distance between the flame on his hand and the cigarette, let the tip of the cigarette burned with the flame.

The back of his hands had particular symbols in black, the same design on both hands, that resembled a barcode.

The design of the symbol was three rows of black bars, but with the second one having a break at the middle, being two short bars.

The design was one of the Hakke symbols, and the symbol was Li.

The symbol of fire.

The heat of the flame did not seem to affect the demon, but a black ring on his finger and the black symbol on his hand turned its color and emitted red light as the flame approached.

A smoke started emerging from the cigarette. A red smoke.

He inhaled, the smoke seeping into his lungs.

As he breathed out, the red smoke came out of his mouth.

A hint of his tongue and his teeth looked black.

Putting the cigarette in his mouth, he resumed his walking.

He was lured into one of the shops in the alley.

The shop had lamps with exotic designs hanging from the eaves.

The red demon disappeared into the shop, leaving a trace of his red smoke.

The shop had a sign that said―

*“The Miran Dark Lamps.”*
