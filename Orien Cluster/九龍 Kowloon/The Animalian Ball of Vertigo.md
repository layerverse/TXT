# The Animalian Ball of Vertigo

_The District Master of the Animalia District_
_requests the pleasure of your company at the_
_Animalian Ball of Vertigo_
_at the Animalia Hall, Time of Convenience_

---

The invitation had a logo at the top, a symbol of the Animalia District.
The symbol was a head of a deer, symmetric, minimalistic and filled art, consisting of straight lines.
The [horns] of the deer looked like electric circuits without the dots.
“Time of Convenience” on the invitation is [a commonly used] term to [suggest/refer to] whatever time of one’s preference.
The concept of time in the Utopian Realm defers from early times and the outside of the Realm where the Eternal technology [is not prominent], and by manipulating the nature of layers, the Eternal technology can meet one’s time with another’s, creating an instance or a pocket of time.

The whole surrounding sparkled with lights.
