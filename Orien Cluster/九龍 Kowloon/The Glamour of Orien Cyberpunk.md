Ethereal neon signs glaring.

Decorative frames and Orien letters in brush or serif styles.

Most of them, the colors are teal and light purple.

Which is the same for the buildings, except the walls are lighter purple or lime that is close to white.

The architecture of the buildings in Kowloon is traditionally Orien, decorative and the roofs having curls at the diagonal edges, pointing upward.

Only that the colors are less traditional.

The buildings are afloat, rows of the buildings infinite, the atmosphere obscuring the sight of the distant buildings.

The rows of the buildings are mostly orderly, yet complexity within blocks here and there.

It creates interesting sights of the air streets, still maintaining the orderly sight of the rows, with the buildings and the air streets, continuing on and fading into the distance.

The structures of the buildings are different horizontal combinations of blocks, that are wings of the building, except the buildings have no parts that are main parts and all the parts are equal.

The blocks of the building are the same size, as if made in a grid.

The buildings have multiple floors, and some have balconies.

The top parts of the buildings have roofs of the traditional Orien style, and the bottom parts have a decorative and tapered part as a finishing end of the building.

Some floors have roofs, adding character to the buildings in balance and design.

The columns and the railings of the balconies are either dusky red purple or teal.

The roofs are either light purple or light teal, and the decorative parts under the roofs have the either color that is opposite to the roof color to contrast.

The air atmosphere of Kowloon has a tint of orange red, except it is a tint of teal, purple or lime in some areas.

Kowloon doesn’t have a day and night cycle as a planet, and some areas have a consistent atmosphere of either day or night, while some areas have a day and night cycle.

Although the Eternalists can make the atmosphere of any area to their liking if they wish.

Along the air streets of the city, surrounded by the rows of the buildings, are air cars flying around.

It is the most common means of transportation in Kowloon.

The cars are less decorative compared to the buildings, and have more modern and sleek designs, although the designs are varied according to individual preferences, and some cars can be decorative.

The exterior of Kowloon is the shape of a dice, with the point edges cut off diagonally, chamfered.

The chamfered parts are the main entrances of the world, along with the center points of the plane sides.

Although the city is open on any part of the world, being a composite of floating buildings, air streets open to the outer space, allowing entrance from any part.

The cube of Kowloon has an ethereal dragon coiled around the world, with its head resting at one point edge of the cube, its mouth being the welcome entrance of the world.

The name of the world, Kowloon, in the Orien language means the Nine Dragons.

The sight of the wide open mouth of the dragon is the first thing the visitors will see, when they are ported to the welcome spot of Kowloon.

Businesses and lives of people and the yakuza flourish all alike, with glittering signs and the infinite rows of the buildings, picturing a mosaic of chaos, which yet creates its own homeostasis of the whole.

The entropy of Kowloon is what they love and cannot escape for its allure.

Should visitors be aware — not to be devoured by the fatal glamour of Kowloon — the Nine Dragons.
