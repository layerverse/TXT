A magnificent hall.

Furniture placed on each wall, as if every wall is a floor.

People as well stand and walk on any wall of the room, transition between different sides freely as they wish.

Each wall has its own gravity, holding things and people onto the wall and acting as a floor.

The large windows on the sides have furniture and people on the glasses â€” if you shift the perspective, it is as though a glass floor.

The central area of the floor side and the ceiling side has a cafeteria or a bar on each.

Androids behind counters, offering services and drinks.

Androids in this world, are called Butlers, and their designs, as the name is telling, resemble the appearances of butlers.

The world is classic, and the name is Vertigo.

It is a massive city planet, with layer manipulation, with no ground but consists only of floating structures and buildings.

The world in another name is the City of Melancholic Euphoria.

This city world is saturated with culture and pleasure.

The buildings are afloat, with mirrored appearances.

Rows of buildings spreading radially, cross sections being circular, connecting the air streets.

The circular cross sections have a spherical building at the center.

The rows of buildings are spread radially, but the buildings are not at slanted angles, and they are still in a grid and orderly.

Some buildings have triangular shapes, so that some of the air streets are diagonal but the buildings are still in a grid, both horizontally and vertically.

Most buildings have protruding windows on the roofs, and some with balconies or terraces.

Such architecture is a traditional style of the Hue culture.

Vehicles fly around freely, with no sense of which is up or down.

At the core of the planet is the Time Sphere.

It is a monument that symbolizes the time that has ever passed and will ever come.

The central part of the Time Sphere is a light star, which works as the sunlight of the planet.

It is bright but not blindly bright, providing optimal light to the central part of the world.

The Sphere has multiple rings around the core, with each telling of the measurement of time in each unit.

Each ring rotates at the speed of its own time.

The Era Ring tells time in eras.

The Age Ring tells time in ages.

The Year Ring tells time in years.

The Month Ring tells time in months.

The Day Ring tells time in days.

The Time Rings in a set tell time in hours, minutes and seconds.

It is for more the monumental purpose than an actual tool for knowing the time.

Regardless of its practicality, it is a beloved monument of this city world.

It is after all the core and the sun of the world.

This sun core is surely not the only source of light in Vertigo, and the usual means of lighting in the air streets of Vertigo is small floating star lights, which usually have lime color.

In some places, the lights can be light teal or light magenta.

Some areas and districts have a constant night atmosphere.

The architecture of Vertigo is typically gothic and decorative.

Colors commonly used in Vertigo are different tints and shades of purple, from reddish to bluish, from muted, dark to bright, then aside from purple are magenta and teal.

White parts of walls are typically sepia tones of white, but some white walls are light shades of purple, teal or lime.

Still, these are only the most typical styles, and the cultures within Vertigo are diverse, and there are many districts with varied cultures and styles.

Some of them are borrowed from other worlds, whose districts are called Hall Districts, themed districts of cultures and styles from a world outside Vertigo.

Most buildings in Vertigo have rooms on the upper side and the lower side with gravity of opposite directions.

Large buildings in Vertigo typically have a hall at the center of the building.

It is a large room with each wall having gravity of its own.

These halls have a variety of purposes, and some halls are used for multiple purposes according to different occasions.

Balls are commonplace in Vertigo, for the traditionality of the world.

One of the popular balls is the Animalian Ball of Vertigo.

It is a masquerade ball of Animalian people, humanoids with animalistic features.

While the theme is as so, the visitors do not have to be in the Animalian form.

The district has a style of nature stylized with minimalism.

Their hall as well is themed with its culture and style.

It is one of the attractions that entice visitors from outside of Vertigo.

As for the city structure, the world of Vertigo is divided into sectors, sections and districts.

Sectors are akin to regions in a continental world, then there are sections within each sector.

The scale of districts varies, and some districts are as large as a city, while some districts are akin to streets and are small areas.

Sectors and sections exist more for the systematic purpose, and people usually refer to places using the names of the districts.

The layer manipulation of Vertigo is not limited to gravity but also space-time and dimensions, and there are districts that utilize the layer manipulation.

Some districts have different speeds of time, and within these districts, time flows differently from the outside of the district.

Some other districts have space compression so that the space inside is larger than the size it appears on the outside.

Districts that offer or host plays are as well popular in Vertigo.

Some districts act as entrances to immersive plays, while some districts host stage plays.

The districts that are focused on offering plays are called play districts, which though is not the titles of these districts and only a common term to refer to this type of districts.

One of the districts that are popular for plays that are immersive, is the Drama District.

The Drama District offers a wide range of immersive plays that take place in each own play world, which is an Eternal layer.

The type of plays this district offers is theatrical and narrative plays, where the player takes a role of the protagonist in the story.

Genres such as noir, where the protagonist is a private detective, are especially popular in Vertigo.

In contrast, one of the districts that is famous for traditional stage plays is the Theatre District.

It offers a variety of theatrical stage plays.

Some of them are played by professional actors, while some of them call for participants and usual people can act and perform, and be part of the show.

Some districts offer both performed plays that take place in rooms, and immersive plays which the players are ported to play worlds.

One example of this type of districts is the Daydream District.

The district offers romance and sexual plays, and according to the preferences of the guest, it can be performed in a room, or is offered as an immersive play that takes place in another play world.

The variety and the vast collection of districts in Vertigo will never subject anyone to boredom, but will forever satiate the residents and the visitors alike.

In the eternal time of Vertigo, people live the lives of culture and pleasure, enchanted by the melancholic euphoria of it all.
